# Robust Operator

**Recipe:** `h100-eks-ubuntu-inference-dynamo`
**Generated:** 2026-03-06 19:40:34 UTC
**Kubernetes Version:** v1.34
**Platform:** linux/amd64

---

Demonstrates CNCF AI Conformance requirement that at least one complex AI operator
with a CRD can be installed and functions reliably, including operator pods running,
webhooks operational, and custom resources reconciled.

## Summary

1. **Dynamo Operator** — Controller manager running in `dynamo-system`
2. **Custom Resource Definitions** — 6 Dynamo CRDs registered (DynamoGraphDeployment, DynamoComponentDeployment, etc.)
3. **Webhooks Operational** — Validating webhook configured and active
4. **Custom Resource Reconciled** — `DynamoGraphDeployment/vllm-agg` reconciled with workload pods running
5. **Supporting Services** — etcd and NATS running for Dynamo platform state management
6. **Result: PASS**

## Dynamo Operator Health

**Dynamo operator deployments**
```
$ kubectl get deploy -n dynamo-system
NAME                                                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
dynamo-platform-dynamo-operator-controller-manager   1/1     1            1           45h
grove-operator                                       1/1     1            1           45h
```

**Dynamo operator pods**
```
$ kubectl get pods -n dynamo-system
NAME                                                              READY   STATUS      RESTARTS      AGE

dynamo-platform-dynamo-operator-webhook-cert-gen-1-qzzdr          0/1     Completed   0             45h

```

## Custom Resource Definitions

**Dynamo CRDs**
```

```

## Webhooks

**Validating webhooks**
```
$ kubectl get validatingwebhookconfigurations -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=dynamo-platform
NAME                                         WEBHOOKS   AGE
dynamo-platform-dynamo-operator-validating   4          45h
```

**Dynamo validating webhooks**
```
dynamo-platform-dynamo-operator-validating   4          45h
```

## Custom Resource Reconciliation

A `DynamoGraphDeployment` defines an inference serving graph. The operator reconciles
it into component deployments with pods, services, and scaling configuration.

**DynamoGraphDeployments**
```
$ kubectl get dynamographdeployments -A
NAMESPACE         NAME       AGE
dynamo-workload   vllm-agg   45h
```

**DynamoGraphDeployment details**
```

### Workload Pods Created by Operator

**Dynamo workload pods**
```
$ kubectl get pods -n dynamo-workload -o wide
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP               NODE                             NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
vllm-agg-0-frontend-kdhdj           1/1     Running   0          45h   10.0.0.10   node-a.example.internal    <none>           <none>
vllm-agg-0-vllmdecodeworker-wmvrk   1/1     Running   0          45h   10.0.0.10   node-a.example.internal   <none>           <none>
```

### Component Deployments

**DynamoComponentDeployments**
```
$ kubectl get dynamocomponentdeployments -n dynamo-workload
No resources found in dynamo-workload namespace.
```

## Webhook Rejection Test

Submit an invalid DynamoGraphDeployment to verify the validating webhook
actively rejects malformed resources.

**Invalid CR rejection**
```
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "STDIN": admission webhook "vdynamographdeployment.kb.io" denied the request: spec.services must have at least one service
```

Webhook correctly rejected the invalid resource.

**Result: PASS** — Dynamo operator running, webhooks operational (rejection verified), CRDs registered, DynamoGraphDeployment reconciled with workload pods.
