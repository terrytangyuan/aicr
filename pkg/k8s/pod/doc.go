Package pod provides shared utilities for Kubernetes Job and Pod operations.

This package consolidates common functionality used by the snapshot agent
(pkg/k8s/agent) and validator Job orchestrator (pkg/validator/job):

  - Job lifecycle: WaitForJobCompletion
  - Pod phase: WaitForPodSucceeded, WaitForPodReady
  - Pod logs: StreamLogs, GetPodLogs
  - ConfigMap URIs: ParseConfigMapURI

All functions use structured error handling (pkg/errors) and respect context
deadlines for proper timeout management.

Example usage:

	// Wait for job completion
	err := pod.WaitForJobCompletion(ctx, client, namespace, jobName, timeout)

	// Wait for pod to succeed
	err := pod.WaitForPodSucceeded(ctx, client, namespace, podName, timeout)

	// Stream pod logs to writer (empty container = first container)
	err := pod.StreamLogs(ctx, client, namespace, podName, "", os.Stdout)

	// Get pod logs as string with specific container
	logs, err := pod.GetPodLogs(ctx, client, namespace, podName, "my-container")
*/
