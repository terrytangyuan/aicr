// Package deployer defines the shared interface and types for bundle deployers.
//
// Each deployer (helm, argocd, argocdhelm) produces deployment artifacts from
// a configured recipe. Deployers are configured as structs with all required
// data, then Generate is called to produce the output.
//
// The Deployer interface enables mockability in bundler tests and provides a
// consistent contract across deployer implementations. Existing deployers
// (helm, argocd) do not yet implement this interface — argocdhelm is the first.
