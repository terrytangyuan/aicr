Eidos (Eidos) provides validated configuration guidance for deploying GPU-accelerated Kubernetes infrastructure. It captures known-good combinations of software, configuration, and system requirements and makes them consumable as documentation and generated deployment artifacts.

## Why We Built This

Running GPU-accelerated Kubernetes clusters reliably is hard. Small differences in kernel versions, drivers, container runtimes, operators, and Kubernetes releases can cause failures that are difficult to diagnose and expensive to reproduce.

Historically, this knowledge has lived in internal validation pipelines, playbooks, and tribal knowledge. Eidos exists to externalize that experience. Its goal is to make validated configurations visible, repeatable, and reusable across environments.

## What Eidos Is (and Is Not)

Eidos is a **source of validated configuration knowledge** for NVIDIA-accelerated Kubernetes environments.

It **is**:
- A curated set of tested and validated component combinations
- A reference for how NVIDIA-accelerated Kubernetes clusters are expected to be configured
- A foundation for generating reproducible deployment artifacts
- Designed to integrate with existing provisioning, CI/CD, and GitOps workflows

It **is not**:
- A Kubernetes distribution
- A cluster provisioning or lifecycle management system
- A managed control plane or hosted service
- A replacement for cloud provider or OEM platforms

## How It Works

Eidos separates **validated configuration knowledge** from **how that knowledge is consumed**.

- Human-readable documentation lives under `docs/`.
- Version-locked configuration definitions (“recipes”) capture known-good system states.
- Those definitions can be rendered into concrete artifacts such as Helm values, Kubernetes manifests, or install scripts.- Recipes can be validated against actual system configurations to verify compatibility.

This separation allows the same validated configuration to be applied consistently across different environments and automation systems.

*For example, a configuration validated for GB200 on Ubuntu 22.04 with Kubernetes 1.34 can be rendered into Helm values and manifests suitable for use in an existing GitOps pipeline.*

## Get Started

> Some tooling and APIs are under active development; documentation reflects current and near-term capabilities.

### Installation

```shell
# Public repository
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/eidos/main/install | bash -s --

# Private repository (requires GitHub token with repo scope)
curl -sfL -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/eidos/main/install | bash -s --
```

See [Installation Guide](docs/user-guide/installation.md) for manual installation, building from source, and container images.

### Quick Start

Get started quickly with Eidos:
1. Review the documentation under `docs/` to understand supported platforms and required components.
2. Identify your target environment:
   - GPU architecture
   - Operating system and kernel
   - Kubernetes distribution and version
   - Workload intent (for example, training or inference)
3. Apply the validated configuration guidance using your existing tools (Helm, kubectl, CI/CD, or GitOps).
4. Validate and iterate as platforms and workloads evolve.

**Example:** Generate a validated configuration for GB200 on EKS with Ubuntu, optimized for PyTorch training:

```bash
# Generate a recipe for your environment
eidos recipe --service eks --accelerator gb200 --os ubuntu --intent training --platform pytorch -o recipe.yaml

# Render the recipe into Helm values for your GitOps pipeline
eidos bundle --recipe recipe.yaml -o ./bundles
```

The generated `bundles/` directory contains a Helm umbrella chart ready to deploy or commit to your GitOps repository. See [CLI Reference](docs/user-guide/cli-reference.md) for more options.
